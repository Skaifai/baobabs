## Project Proposal
### Keywords: Top-Down View, Pixel, RPG

## Introduction:
We propose to develop a top-down pixel RPG game that combines exploration, adventure, and combat elements set in a fantasy world. The game will be developed for PC and mobile platforms, targeting casual gamers who enjoy role-playing games with retro-style graphics and immersive gameplay.

## Gameplay:
The game will be a single-player, open-world RPG game that allows the player to explore a vast world filled with mythical creatures, hidden treasures, and secrets. The game's combat system will be turn-based, where the player can use different skills and abilities to defeat enemies, and the game's leveling system will allow the player to upgrade their character's abilities and attributes. The game will also have a crafting system that allows players to create their own weapons and items to aid them in their journey.

## Art Style:
The game will feature a retro-style pixel art style, reminiscent of classic RPG games from the 90s. The game's world will be filled with vibrant colors and details, with each region of the world having its unique environments, creatures, and NPCs.

## Storyline:
The game's story will revolve around a young adventurer who embarks on a journey to uncover the secrets of a mystical land filled with ancient ruins, forgotten temples, and magical artifacts. The player will interact with various NPCs throughout the game, each with their unique backstory and quests, and will unravel a larger overarching story that ties them all together.

## Features:

An open-world environment that allows the player to explore freely.
A turn-based combat system with a variety of skills and abilities to choose from.
A crafting system that allows the player to create their weapons and items.
